      <h2 id="about-heading">About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a cybersecurity and infrastructure executive with 20+ years shaping enterprise security architecture,
        cyber recovery strategy, and Zero Trust modernization across global financial services, energy, and government
        sectors. My work spans Fortune-20 cloud transformations, modernization of mission-critical platforms, and the
        development of resilient security architectures that protect organizations at massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in translating complex cyber risk into clear, actionable architecture strategies that strengthen
        regulatory posture, reduce operational exposure, and enable secure digital transformation. My experience includes
        leading Zero Trust for 74,000+ users at ExxonMobil, modernizing JPMorgan Chase’s cyber recovery and architecture
        governance model, and advancing USAA’s enterprise cybersecurity posture with AI-assisted detection, OT/IoT
        security enhancements, and NIST-aligned Zero Trust roadmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        My leadership style blends technical depth with executive influence—aligning security capabilities with business
        outcomes, establishing federated governance models, and mentoring architecture teams to deliver secure-by-design
        solutions. I excel in environments where resiliency, modernization, and long-term strategic thinking are essential.
